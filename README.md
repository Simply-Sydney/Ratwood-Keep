## LAMIA PROJECT

Todo List:
- Lamia tail body slot, tail should have natural armor value for 'scales'
- Rerout attacks from legs and feet to upper tail or lower tail
- Allow recolor of tail through sprite accessories
- Add a couple clothing options for tail, stocking / skirt
- Snek language (maybe same as sissean?)
- LORE and RENAME to fit Ratwood
- Coil grabbing and crushing mechanics
- Paralysis poison fang bite when victim is coiled
- Vary speed based on terrain: faster on rough ground, slower on smooth
- Tense->lunging strike, like a cobra
- Random name list
- Heratige / tribal background
- Custom erp interactions while coiled
- Tail wrap around objects, rooting Lamia in place
- (POSSIBLY) Use tail to pull person 1 tile to them if they are close enough (not sure on this one yet)
- Piercing gaze that panics target, like a weak power of Medusa (not sure on this one yet either)
- (POSSIBLY) Heat mechanics, this would be a big addition so is only an idea for now, but cold blooded and all that
- Dissable mount riding

## Lamia Spells and Interactions
- Piercing Gaze (again, maybe not sure)
- Lunging Strike (after tensing up period)
- Enwrap (tail grabbing and crushing of mobs, should root in place if targeting structure)
- Paralysis Bite (only after coiling victim)

## Design Philosophy
```
While mechanically unique, the biggest change from a normal mob is the tail obviously.
Some fun unique interactions and erp mechanics to make the race feel different.
Should bring variety and spice to Rockhill, but MUST be balanced in a way to not feel overpowered
```

## Lore
```
WIP, I hate making up lore
